## Angelhack 2019 Bogotá

This a submission for the Angelhack hackathon Bogotá 2019.
It uses a [charting package](https://flutterawesome.com/a-charting-package-for-flutter-supporting-both-android-and-ios/) to display payment projections. If an available income is specified, graphs will be color coded to reflect if spending should be moderated or not in the upcoming months.

It contains information on interest rates, credit, and general information relevant for people beginning their credit life.

Plan your expenses, and enjoy the benefits of a sustainable credit projection.
